  I'm an Argentinian design engineer based in the US. I led design teams in the past, founded two venture-backed startups, and now work as an IC, blending product, design, and engineering expertise to create unique solutions.

  Currently, I'm a Design Engineer at [Footprint](https://onefootprint.com), working across design and frontend teams with both Figma and production code. If you're interested in the boring details, you can check my [resume](/resume).
