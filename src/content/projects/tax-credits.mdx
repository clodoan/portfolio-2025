<Paragraph>
  A redesign of our tax credits flow to make it feel lighter and improve conversion.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  ## Before
  Previous designs featured a lot of text and a lot of steps. While it worked, it felt heavy and didn't feel like a native app.

<Paragraph>
  ## After
  The redesigned flow I worked on uses a more native approach, with a floating action sheet for state transitions and a confirmation screen after capture. This feels more lightweight and user-friendly.
