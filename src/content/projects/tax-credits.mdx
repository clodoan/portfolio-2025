<Paragraph>
  ## Before
  R&D credits are a tough concept for users to understand. Particularly when there are multiple types of credits coming from different states and at different times.

<Paragraph>
  We had lots of problems with previous designs because they failed at showing the right information at the right time, and it was hard for users to have a clear idea of what they were supposed to do in order to get their tax credits in their accounts.
  <br />
  We had one card per each R&D program, so the most important information was many times buried into a long list of cards. There was an attempt to solve the problem by adding a tasks section at the top, but it didn't feel right: we were duplicating information, it made the UI feel cluttered and it was hard to make the link between the tasks and the cards.

  ## After
  I led the redesign of this flow. The main concept of this work was to consolidate the information in a single place, removing the noise and making it easier for users to focus on the most important task to achieve next.

  This new R&D card component would show only the current state on focus, and what will happen next in a concise way that works as a guide for the user of what to expect in the future. Each card would group R&D programs that share the same timeline for consolidating and grouping information in a more effective way. 
  Steps that are completed become collapsed by default, and can be expanded in case the user wants to review what they have done.
