  ## Mobile onboarding flow
  Among other things, I worked on the mobile onboarding flow, particularly the document scanning flow. The changes introduced improved the conversion rate by almost 25% and it is one of the most valued improvements by our customers.

 The redesigned flow I worked on uses a more native approach, with a floating action sheet for state transitions and a confirmation screen after capture. This feels more lightweight and user-friendly.
