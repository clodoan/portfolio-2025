<Paragraph>
  A redesign of our new document scanning flow to make it feel lighter and improve conversion.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  ## Before
  Previous designs featured entire screens for state transitions and image confirmation after capture. While it worked, it felt heavy and didn't feel like a native app.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 rounded-2xl p-4 md:p-8 max-w-full overflow-hidden items-center justify-center bg-cover bg-center bg-no-repeat" style={{
    backgroundImage: "url('/projects/backgrounds/nature-5.jpg')",
    marginBlock: "1rem",
  }}>
    <Image src="/projects/id-doc/scan-processing.png" alt="Scan processing" width={320} height={640} className="w-full h-full object-cover shadow-md" />
    <Image src="/projects/id-doc/scan-success.png" alt="Scan success" width={320} height={640} className="w-full h-full object-cover shadow-md" />
  </div>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  ## After
  The redesigned flow I worked on uses a more native approach, with a floating action sheet for state transitions and a confirmation screen after capture. This feels more lightweight and user-friendly.

  Thanks to this new approach we were able to improve the conversion rate by almost 25% and reduce the number of steps by 2.
