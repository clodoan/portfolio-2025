  ## Mobile onboarding flow
  I worked on improving the mobile onboarding flow, especially the document scanning experience. The updates led to nearly a 25% boost in conversion rate and have been one of the most appreciated changes by our users.

  The new flow takes a more native, intuitive approach â€” using a floating action sheet for smoother transitions and reusing it for the confirmation screen after capture. It feels lighter, faster, and more practical overall.
